            "avatar": "",
            "answer": "Well, React Native is the tool that turns a cross-platform app into a native-like app. It has the same look as the native app, so it is the first advantage of the React Native tool. Then, since it is a cross-platform tool, it means that both Android and iOS apps have one codebase. It is much convenient for developers to fix some bugs in one codebase rather than deal with each app separately. Development speed is the next advantage that arises from the previous strong side. One codebase for two apps is created faster than codebase for each platform. So the development time is reduced substantially. Finally, the cost. Reduced development time means saved costs. Moreover, you get two apps that cost as one app. You save your budget and deliver your customers a perfect product. So, Cadabra Studio votes for using React Native since this tool has a lot of advantages.",
